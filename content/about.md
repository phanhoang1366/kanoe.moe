If you are curious why this website exists, here is my story.

One of my (obscure) hobbies is to check domain names relating to Blue Archive characters and register one of them. Since I am a big fan of Takanashi Hoshino, I tried checking if [hoshino.moe](https://hoshino.moe) is available. I used the `whois` command:

```
% whois hoshino.moe
Domain Name: hoshino.moe
Registry Domain ID: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namecheap.com
Registrar URL: http://www.namecheap.com
Updated Date: 2024-10-27T21:07:57Z
Creation Date: 2024-10-22T21:07:57Z
Registry Expiry Date: 2025-10-22T21:07:57Z
Registrar: NameCheap, Inc.
```

Oh well, it is already registered. As of right now, [hoshino.moe](https://hoshino.moe) gives a timeout error. Out of curiosity, I checked Shiroko, mascot of the game:

```
% whois shiroko.moe
Domain Name: shiroko.moe
Registry Domain ID: REDACTED FOR PRIVACY
Registrar WHOIS Server: https://porkbun.com/whois
Registrar URL: www.porkbun.com
Updated Date: 2025-01-31T03:11:16Z

Registry Expiry Date: 2026-01-27T07:38:26Z
```

Same thing, already registered and not responding. Since I don't have time to manually check every character, I wrote a script to check all the characters in Blue Archive and put it on the front page of this website. If you want to check if your favorite character's domain is available, just `Ctrl+F` and search for it.

# Under Construction!

I'm currently (not) working on this website. The final result will be a website that checks the availability of domain names related to Blue Archive characters.

In the meantime, why don't you grab some domain names before someone else does?

- [momoka.moe](https://porkbun.com/checkout/search?q=momoka.moe) (Premium domain smh)
- [nonomi.moe](https://porkbun.com/checkout/search?q=nonomi.moe)
- [suzumi.moe](https://porkbun.com/checkout/search?q=suzumi.moe)
- [reisa.moe](https://porkbun.com/checkout/search?q=reisa.moe) (Added those 2 because of the recent event)
